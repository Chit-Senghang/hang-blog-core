          # Here, you would add the deployment steps specific to your project.
          # This can include copying files to a server, deploying to a cloud platform, etc.
          # Replace the following with your actual deployment steps.

          # Example: Deploy to a hypothetical server using SSH
          ssh user@server.example.com "cd /path/to/your/app && git pull origin main && restart-your-app"

          # Ensure that you have SSH access and the necessary permissions set up for this to work.
